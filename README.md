# spaceInvaders
I made a basic spaceInvaders game using p5.js library

I wrote different files for ship(player's ship), enemy(enemies), laser and enemy laser.
I also included a health pack that spawns from time to time and it increases the player's HP the quicker it gets it.

This was done for fun.
